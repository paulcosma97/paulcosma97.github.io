    8   8aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa8aaaaaaaaaaa8aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa8aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa8aaa8

    I bet it took you more than 10 seconds :-).
    Fine, have a look.

            <h3>Skillset</h3>
            <p>
                I understand the challenges of being a developer so here are several things I can handle.
            </p>

            <table class="table">
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td>JavaScript</td>

                        <td>Spring Boot</td>
                        <td>Angular</td>
                        <td>Hibernate</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>SAP UI5</td>
                        <td>jQuery</td>
                        <td>Laravel</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>MySQL</td>
                        <td>MariaDB</td>
                        <td>Mongo</td>

                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>

            <p>
                And here's a list of other technologies I had the chance to work with.
            </p>

            <table class="table">
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Express</td>
                        <td>Symfony</td>
                        <td>Kotlin</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>React</td>
                        <td>Vue</td>
                        <td><!-- Can't wait for the day I'll fill this blank cell --></td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>

            <h4>Communication</h4>
            <p>
                I believe that communication is a must. 
                To reach this goal I use tools like Slack and Skype but the face-to-face conversations are the ones that rule over the others.
            </p>

            <h4>Time Management</h4>
            <p>
                My aim is to always work efficiently and finish my tasks on time.
                Time can be your friend or your biggest enemy. It depends on how you organize it.   
            </p>

            <h4>Organization</h4>
            <p>
                I realize the importance of good organization. 
                For this I like to use Trello, Waffle and GitLab's integrated application.
            </p>
        </div>
    </section>
    
    <section id="portfolio">
        <div class="container col-md-8 col-lg-6">
            <h3>My Work</h3>
            <p>
                Here's a list of recent projects that I have worked on.
            </p> 
            

            <h4>DIPKO - "Digitale Plattform f√ºr kommunale Services"</h4>
            <p>
                I am currently working on this project. It is a uniform platform with central access to all municipal offers.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this project I work in a team of 7 developers, from Romania and Germany. 
                Here I deal with both the front-end and the back-end tasks, make code reviews and design.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some highlights in the technologies I use are Express, Typescript on both front-end and back-end, Angular, GraphQL, Docker,
                Keycloak, Mocha, Cypress, TypeORM, PostgreSQL and JWT.
            </p>


            <h4>Member-In-Out Portal</h4>
            <p>
                Application made for an international life insurance company that handles the employees' insurances.
            </p>
            <p>
                I worked in a small team of three developers. 
                My role was to do the whole back-end part while my colleagues took care of the front-end.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here I used technologies such as Spring Boot, OAuth2 through Gluu Server, Hibernate, SAP UI5, jQuery and Apache POI.
            </p>


            <h4>Travel Expenses</h4>
            <p>
                This web application was created with the purpose of managing employees' travel expenses in the company.
            </p>
            <p>
                The team was constantly changing but there were an average of 4 - 8 developers actively working on it.
                On Travel Expenses I mostly had to deal with back-end and occasionally front-end tasks.
            </p>
            <p>
                One great experience during the project's development was that I had the chance to be the SCRUM Master.
                This helped me helped develop a sense of leadership and management skills.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some of the technologies I used here are Spring Boot, SAP UI5, PostgreSQL, Mongo, Apache POI, Hibernate, Cron jobs and so on.
            </p>


            <h4>Overseer</h4>
            <p>
                This is a personal project of mine. It is an aspect oriented typescript framework for back-end which 
                takes inspiration from Spring Boot and Angular.
            </p>
            <p>
                It it supposed to combine the <em>good</em> parts of both Spring and Angular and leave the <em>bad</em> ones.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am currently working on it but here is the <a target="blank" href="https://github.com/paulcosma97/overseer">GitHub repository</a>.
            </p>


            <h4>iRe</h4>
            <p>
                A highly complex web application that dealt with the <em>magic</em> of re-insurance business logic. 
            </p>
            <p>
                We worked in teams of 6, with teams in 3 different cities and 2 countries. 
                We communicated through Skype, Slack and emails while the tasks were organized in in Jira.
            </p>
            <p>
                I only worked on this project a few months since I had another one coming soon. My job was to do front-end pages and logic.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the time I mostly used SAP UI5 for page building and jQuery for requests.
            </p>


            <h4>Candidate Management</h4>
            <p>
                Application made with the purpose of managing candidates for internship at the company.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this project I worked mostly on the front-end side with React and did some back-end refactoring, testing and validation.
            </p>
